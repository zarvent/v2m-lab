# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2026-05-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record architecture decisions systematically to facilitate onboarding of new developers and maintain technical consistency over time.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document important decisions, including context, options considered, and consequences.

## Consequences

* Decisions will be transparent and traceable.
* Discipline is required to write an ADR for each significant change.
