# 🗣️ Voice2Machine: Local Voice Dictation

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is simple:

> **To be able to dictate text anywhere in the operating system.**

The idea is to transcribe audio using your local GPU to obtain maximum speed and accuracy, regardless of the application you are using (code editor, browser, chat, etc.).

This project transforms a simple script into a robust modular application based on **Python** (Backend) and **Tauri** (Frontend), designed under Hexagonal Architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and absolute privacy.
