# 🗣️ INTRODUCTION TO THE VOICE DICTATION TOOL

## 🎯 PURPOSE

The goal is simple:

> Be able to dictate text anywhere in the operating system

The idea is to transcribe audio with a GPU for maximum speed, regardless of which application you're using.

This project is a refactoring from a simple script to a modular Python application to separate responsibilities and facilitate future maintenance.
