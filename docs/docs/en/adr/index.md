# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision, along with its context and consequences.

## Decision Index

*Currently, there are no formal decisions recorded in this format. New decisions will be added here.*

## When to write an ADR?

Write an ADR when you make a significant decision that affects the project's structure, dependencies, interfaces, or technology.

See [ADR Template](template.md) for the format.
