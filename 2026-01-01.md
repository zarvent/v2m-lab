target:
 - AGENTS.md
 - AGENTES.md
 - README.md
 - LEEME.md
 - .md

<keep in mind>
- The original file, “the source of truth,” is the one with the English name. For example, README.md is the original, and LEEME.md is the one that must be in Spanish and contain the same information as README.md.
- if (the file is in Spanish){
translate it into native US American English without changing the original meaning
}

if (the file is in English){
translate it into native Latin American Spanish without changing the original meaning
}
</keep in mind>

<it would be nice if you>
and that goes for all markdown files (.md)

I want each markdown file to have a file in native US American English and native Latin American Spanish

for example, if there is a markdown file:
README.md --> LEEME.md

README.md:
must be in native US American English

LEEME.md
should be in native Latin American Spanish

Both should have the same information
